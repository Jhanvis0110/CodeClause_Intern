Project-1


Music Player in Python:


To build the music player, you require the Tkinter, PyGame, and the OS module. 

Tkinter: Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python you can use to create desktop applications. 

It offers a variety of widgets like buttons, labels, icons and text boxes so you can develop apps in no time.

This is my allocated project of codeclause internship.




Project-2


Mail Application With GUI

This is a GUI Based Mail Application Using Tkinter & Smtplib Modules.

Tkinter: Tkinter is the de facto way in Python to create Graphical User interfaces (GUIs) and is included in all standard Python Distributions. In fact, it's the only framework built into the Python standard library.

Smtplib: The smtplib module defines an SMTP client session object that can be used to send mail to any internet machine with an SMTP or ESMTP listener daemon. For details of SMTP and ESMTP operation, consult RFC 821 (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) and RFC 1869 (SMTP Service Extensions).

This is my golden project of codeclause internship.
